""The hackers exploited a """"vulnerability between contract calls"""" 
""""Poly has a contract called the """"EthCrossChainManager"""". It's a privileged contract that has the right to trigger messages from another chain. It's a standard thing for cross-chain projects.It has a function named verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx that anyone can call to execute a cross-chain transaction.It (1) verifies that the block header is correct by checking signatures (seems the other chain was a poa sidechain or) and then (2) checks that the transaction was included within that block with a Merkle proof. Here's the code.
One of the last things the function does is call executeCrossChainTx, which makes the call to the target contract. This is where the critical flaw sits. Poly checks that the target is a contract, but they forgot to prevent users from calling a very important target... the EthCrossChainData contract By sending this cross-chain message, the user could trick the EthCrossChainManager into calling the EthCrossChainData contract, passing the onlyOwner check. Now the user just had to craft the right data to be able to trigger the function that changes the public keysâ€?

521,179,2020-11-12,Akropolis was attacked by exploiting its flawed handling of the deposit logic in its SavingsModule smart contract***.This incident was due to a bug in the protocol without (1) validating the supported tokens and (2) enforcing reentrancy protection on the deposit logic. The exploitation leads to a large number of pooltokens minted without being backed by valuable assets. The redemption of these minted pooltokens is then exercised to drain about 2.0mn DAI from the affected YCurve and sUSD pools.This hack is initialized from a malicious ERC20-like contract (located at 0xe230). This malicious contract implements a hook that will be invoked whenever the transferFrom() (function signature: 0x23b872dd) is being called.,https://peckshield.medium.com/akropolis-incident-root-cause-analysis-c11ee59e05d4,Akropolis,0x1cec0e358f882733c5ecc028d8a0c24baee02004,SavingsModule,Smart Contract Layer,Untrusted callee / Race conditions,Reentrancy

This swap was done on 1inch, which requires other smart contracts to pass certain addresses and calldata generated by the 1inch API to execute the right functions on the 1inch smart contract.
Enabling the smart contract at risk to conduct arbitrary low-level calls that were intended to only execute swaps on 1inch made it possible for the potential exploit to occur.

555,191,2021-7-18,"First, the attacker invoked the buy function of the Array Finance. The attacker gained 430 ARRAY tokens minted by the Array Finance using 45.91 WETH.
Then the attacker invoked the joinPool function of a closed source contract (Array Collater - 0xa800cda5) five times. He/she deposited 676,410.58 DAI + 679,080.46 USDC + 901.82 WETH + 20 WBTC + 20 renBTC and gained 726.38 aBPT tokens minted by Array Collater.
The attacker invoked the sell function to burn 430 ARRAY tokens and got 77.17 aBPT tokens.
At last, the attacker invoked the exitPool function of the Array Collater. He/she burned 804.55 aBPT tokens obtained in previous two steps and obtained 748,271.55 DAI + 751,225.08 USDC + 997.62 WETH + 22.63 WBTC + 22.74 renBTC.
From Figure 2, we can find the attacker gains profits in step 5 (Figure 2: Invoke the sell function). That's because the obtained 77.17 aBPT tokens are more valuable than the 49.9142 WETH deposited in step 3 (Figure 2: Invoke the buy function).
